# Section Recap

- To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation.****
- Big O notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm.
- Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only general trends,
- The time or space complexity depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to rune the algorithm.
