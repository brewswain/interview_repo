# Introduction to Problem Solving

Let's begin by defining what an algorithm actually is, then devise a plan to solve algorithms.

### What *is* an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task. 

Everything that we do in programming involves some kind of algorithm. It's the foundation for being a successful problem solver and developer. Also of this is important for interviews lol so for the love of God take this seriously.

### How do you improve?

- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns


### Problem Solving Approach

- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break it Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor

We'll look at the above steps in the rest of this section.
