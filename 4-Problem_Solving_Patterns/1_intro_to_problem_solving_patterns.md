# Intro to Problem Solving Patterns

The last section was devoted to devising a plan for solving problems. This section is about mastering some common patterns that can come in handy sometimes.

Keep in mind that this isn't some kind of panacea, but this will probably help you out.

An example of some of these patterns include:
- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking

All of these are different approaches or patterns for writing code. Treat them like a blueprint.
